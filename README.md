# MultivariableAnalysis
This repository is for devloping and maintaining R guides for the EPIET multivariable analysis (MVA) module.

Have uploaded Ashley's dplyr versions. There is one folder for windows and one for mac OS (probably just a file format difference)

Have also uploaded the berlin GIS case study.
